Welcome to my personal corner on the web. This site is a space where I share a mix of personal experiences, technical knowledge, and reflections on topics that matter to me. It’s part journal, part tech blog, and part resource hub—open to all who find value in what I write.

## What You'll Find Here

### Linux How-Tos & Shell Scripting
I document practical guides, troubleshooting tips, and scripting techniques, mainly using Bash and Dash, aimed at making everyday Linux use more efficient.

### Web Development Snippets
From JavaScript tricks to CSS tweaks and HTML structures, I share simple, focused solutions that I’ve used or found helpful in projects.

### Myanmar labor Laws & Industry Insights
As someone with over 8 years of hands-on experience in the garment industry, I write about labor law, compliance, and CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility), particularly in the context of manufacturing and factory operations.

### Open Diary
This is my personal diary made public—not for display, but for connection. I write openly about thoughts, life lessons, and daily reflections that may resonate with others or simply serve as a trace of a life lived attentively.

### Others
Occasionally, I share:
- Notes on privacy, tech philosophy, or digital tools
- Observations from everyday life
- General curiosities or ideas that don’t fit into any category
- Anything worth archiving or reflecting on later
