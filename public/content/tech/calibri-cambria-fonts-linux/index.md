Calibri font is default body font in MS Word. Sometime you may need to install Calibri and Cambria fonts for opening MS Office files with LibreOffice in Linux.

To install the fonts, you can look at https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Microsoft_fonts. But the easiest and cleanest way is to install Carlito and Caladea fonts. Both are metrically compatible with Calibri and Cambria respectively. They are available in Linux. In Arch Linux, ttf-carlito and ttf-caladea packages are provided.
