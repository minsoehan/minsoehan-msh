This is my personal, public diary where I share thoughts, experiences, and notes for later reference—and for others who may find them useful. While the content is openly accessible, it reflects my own views and journey, and should be used with individual discretion. I make no guarantees about accuracy or outcomes, and I am not responsible for any negative consequences resulting from the use of this diary’s content.
